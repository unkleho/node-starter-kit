  "title": "TAL & Dai-ichi Life Derby collection of natural history watercolours, 1790s / compiled by Aylmer Bourke Lambert ; acquired by the 13th Earl of Derby",
  "description": "Six albums comprising 745 watercolours (one landscape, 10 of quadrupeds, 326 of birds, 32 of fish and 376 of plants), including works by and after Thomas Watling, the Port Jackson Painter, The Sydney Bird Painter, and others, the majority dating to the first decade following settlement. \n\nSERIES 01 (Volumes 01-03)\nNew South Wales drawings (‘The Lambert Drawings’), 225 watercolours in three volumes together with John Latham's autograph letter signed to Aylmer Bourke Lambert, [Romsey] 26 January 1800, concerning the return and contents of the albums, 3 pages, with address leaf.\nVolume 01\nNew South Wales drawings (‘The Lambert Drawings’), 81 watercolours\nVolume 02\nNew South Wales drawings (‘The Lambert Drawings’), 95 watercolours\nVolume 03\nNew South Wales drawings (‘The Lambert Drawings’), 49 watercolours\n\nFolio (430 x 280mm.), contemporary calf gilt, rebacked by Hodgson, Liverpool, the calf spine gilt in compartments with red and dark green morocco lettering pieces titled ‘NEW SOUTH WALES DRAWINGS’, the 13th Earl of Derby’s bookplate on front pastedown. \n\n114 of the 225 watercolours in these three albums are on paper watermarked 1794 / J WHATMAN’ (the others sheets not watermarked, but probably most from the same stock). The watermarks on the Watling drawings (Natural History Museum, London) appear to be earlier (these include J Whatman; Britannia; Horn (bugle); C Taylor; L Munn; Fleur de lys). The inscriptions on the reverse of several of the plates in volume 1, titling the subjects, are in a contemporary hand, and the titles are similar to, but not identical with, the titles on some of the Watling drawings.\n200 of the 225 subjects that comprise the ‘Lambert Drawings’ relate to works in the Watling Collection, and of the 25 that are not in Watling, mostly birds, at least four (volume 1, pls 12, 21 and 32, and volume 2, pl. 2) are subjects which relate to listed but now lost Watling drawings.\n\nSERIES 02 (Volume 04)\nZoology of N. [New] Holland etc., 32 watercolours of fish and 112 watercolours of birds\n\nSERIES 03 (Volumes 05-06)\nDrawings of plants of New South Wales, botanical watercolours in two albums\nVolume 05\nDrawings of plants of New South Wales, approximately 259 botanical watercolours\nVolume 06\nDrawings of plants from New South Wales, 113 botanical watercolours\n\nThese 372 botanical drawings add significantly to the smaller groups of 59 botanical drawings in the Watling Collection and 15 botanical drawings in the Banks Ms34 collections in the Natural History Museum, London.\n\nVolume 05: ‘DRAWINGS OF PLANTS OF NEW SOUTH WALES’ includes just one sheet signed (twice, with initials) by Thomas Watling. The majority of the watercolours in the album by one or two hands, the six watercolours inscribed with Paterson’s name on the versos are on a heavier wove paper without watermark and are by another hand. The inscriptions on the verso of most of the sheets possibly in White or Watling’s hand. One inscription, on the reverse of 140 is dated (‘October 1794 leaf and flower 2/3 the Natural Size. very common about runs of water & moist swampy grounds. Flowers in Sept. & Octr.’) and is on paper watetmarked ‘1794 / J WHATMAN’.\n\nVolume 06: DRAWINGS OF PLANTS FROM NEW SOUTH WALES’, the watermarks, most of which are earlier than the one dated watermark which features in the album (J WHATMAN 1794) suggest these drawings may pre-date the drawings in Volume 05 (Drawings of Plants of New South Wales). Britannia, the horn (bugle) and J WHATMAN are all watermarks found on sheets in the Watling and Banks Ms34 Collections in the Natural History Museum, London. \nThe inscription on one page “Hort: Lee. Hammersmith. / 1798.” refers to James Lee’s famous horticultural nursery which pioneered the introduction of plants from New Holland. The Mountain Devil (Lambertia formosa, named for Aylmer Bourke Lambert) of New South Wales was among the first Australian plants to be brought into cultivation in Europe.\n\n‘In 1775 Lee and Kennedy of the Vineyard Nursery, Hammersmith - then a village outside London - offered for sale the first Australian plants, Casuarina quadrivalvis (Allocasuarina strlcta). In 1785, they offered: Banksia oblongifolia, B.serrata, Fabrica laevigata (Leptospermum laevigatum) Lambertia formosa, Melaleuca armillaris with an addition in 1789 of Metrosideros hispida (Angophora hispida) ,.. James Lee was especially interested in Australian plants and, at his own expense, sent out David Burton to collect seed and plants for the firm. In about 1787 Lee published a 4 page pamphlet entitled ‘Rules for Collection and Preserving Seed from Botany Bay’. ... Perhaps Lee’s pamphlet was intended for settlers, military, warders and their families, as well as convicts who would become free men when their sentences expired. Seed collected by these early settlers from the Port Jackson area included Acacia linifolia, A.juniperina, A.myrtifolia, A.verticillata, Eucalyptus resinifera, E.robusta, Goodia lotifolia, Isopogon anemonifolius, Platylobium parvislorurum, P.formosus and Pultenaea retusa.’ (B. Halliwell, ‘Some Australian plants in cultivation in England by 1800’, Eucryphia, newsletter of the Australian Plants Society, Tasmania, September 2002)",

        "value": "Aylmer Bourke Lambert (1761-1842) was Vice President of the Linnaean Society of London for nearly 50 years. He was a friend and correspondent of Sir Joseph Banks, and took a great interest in the botanical and zoological discoveries emerging from New Holland in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, as they were transmitted back to London, whether as living or dead specimens, as seeds, or as drawings. Lambert compiled the collection from Surgeon General John White's specimens and drawings brought from Sydney to London in 1795.\n\nEdward Smith Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby, KG (1775-1851), was a legendary collector and botanist, President of the Linnaean Society and of the Zoological Society of London. By the time of his death in 1851, his menagerie and aviary on 100 acres of land and 70 acres of water at Knowsley, just a few miles east of Liverpool, included over 100 species of mammals and 300 species of birds, the zoological museum in the house contained over 20,000 specimens of mammals, birds, eggs and lower vertebrates, and the library an unparalleled collection of natural history drawings and books. Earl of Derby acquired the drawings from Lambert's estate sale in 1842."

Holland etc.’) suggests some of the drawings must follow the settlement of Van Diemen’s Land in 1803.\n\nThe watermarks are mostly early, c.l770-1790, and include the Whatman, Britannia, Taylor and Horn (bugle), watermarks which feature on the Watling Collection papers used both by Watling and the Port Jackson Painter. \n\nThe fishes include some variants of the unsigned works, given to the Port Jackson Painter, in the Watling Collection:\n\nWatling drawing no.:\n372 “Wel-gnoo-roo”\n375 “Karra gnorra”\n378 “Goe in mag gee”\n379 “Mannadaang”\n\nand appear to be by the same hand. \n\nThey are all further in the same embellishing hand which titles, amongst others, Watling Collection nos 378 and 379, and Port Jackson Drawings (Banks Ms34) nos 64 and 66. \n\nThe birds include variants of subjects and species featured in the Banks Ms34, Watling and Lambert Collections: for example the drawing here of the Caspian Tern (Hydroprogne caspia) is a variant of the watercolour in the Watling Collection (Watling no. 340); and some new images, of which the female black swan is the most remarkable, by or after the Port Jackson Painter, the image copied in the Lambert Drawings (vol. 1 Pl.80), and the companion to the male black swan in the Watling Collection. \n\nFor a discussion of the male black swan by the Port Jackson Painter in the Watling Collection, its possible sources, and of the subsequent engravings, and of the same subject sold at Christie’s Australia, Melbourne, 6-7 December 1994, subsequently given to the ‘Sydney Bird Painter’ and now in the Vizard Foundation, see Jane Lennon, Art and Science: Early Australian Natural History Drawings and Engravings, in Australiana, August 1995, pp.72-77 (where the illustrations of the two drawings are transposed).\n\nThe watercolours are listed in numerical order as they appear in the album. Titles of the majority of the subjects are as follows: current common name where identified; according to Latham’s penciled English or Latin identifications on the watercolours; from the titles given to the matching Watling Collection subjects in the Natural History Museum, London (First Fleet Artwork Collection). The first number in brackets refers to the old Watling drawing number, the second number in brackets refer to the post-1984 Watling mount number.\nItems listed “watercolour on paper watermarked ?” indicates that the watermark is not visible.\n\n1 Unidentified fish\t\t\t\t\nwatercolour on paper watermarked ?\n\n2 Unidentified fish\t\t\t\t\nwatercolour on paper watermarked ‘I Taylor’\n\t\t\t\t\t\n3 Unidentified fish\t\t\t\nwatercolour on paper watermarked ?\n\n4 Unidentified fish\t\t\t\nwatercolour on paper watermarked ?\n\n5 Unidentified fish\t\t\t\t\nwatercolour on paper watermarked ‘T French’\n\n6 Unidentified fish\t\t\nwatercolour on paper watermarked ?\n\n7 Unidentified fish\t\t\t\nwatercolour on paper watermarked ?\n\n8 Unidentified fish\nwatercolour on paper watermarked ‘I Taylor’\n\n9 Unidentified fish\t\nwatercolour on paper watermarked ?\n\n10 Unidentified fish\t\t\t\nwatercolour on paper watermarked ‘Britannia’\n\n11 Unidentified fish\t\nwatercolour on paper watermarked ‘I Taylor’\n\n12 Unidentified fish\t\nwatercolour on paper watermarked  ?\n\n13 Unidentified fish\nwatercolour on paper watermarked  ‘Britannia’?\n\n14 Unidentified fish\t\nwatercolour on paper watermarked ?\n\n15 Unidentified fish\nwatercolour on paper watermarked ?\n\n16 Unidentified fish\t\nwatercolour on paper watermarked ?\n\n17 Unidentified fish \nwatercolour on paper watermarked ‘J Whatman’\t\t\t\n\n18 Unidentified fish\t\nwatercolour on paper watermarked ?\n\n19 Unidentified fish \nwatercolour on paper watermarked ‘J Whatman’\n\n20 Unidentified fish \nwatercolour on paper watermarked ‘J Whatman’\n\n21 Unidentified fish \nwatercolour on paper watermarked ‘J Whatman’\n\n22 Unidentified fish \nWrasse?
